/**
 * <p>
 * The class {@code Action} represents a high-level change that can happen in the {@link Engine}. An {@code Action}
 * causes one or more {@link Modification Modifications} to happen. These are stored in a list, so they can be
 * {@linkplain #revert() reverted} if necessary.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As an {@code Action} represents an executable, replayable, and even revertable piece of code, calling it is of
 * course delicate; the goal is to get the same result every time it is applied. To achieve this, it is necessary
 * that the original state of the engine is compatible with the action. For a new action, this is the
 * responsibility of the user. For replaying actions on the same or different engines, Harmonic ensures this by
 * associating the action with the same state as the user originally did; together with Harmonic's requirement of
 * determinism of the engine, this should ensure the expected behavior.
 * </p>
