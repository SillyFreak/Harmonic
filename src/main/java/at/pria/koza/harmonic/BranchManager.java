/**
 * <p>
 * A {@code BranchManager} is a wrapper for an {@link Engine}. It enables easy and efficient synchronization
 * between multiple BranchManagers by managing metadata for the states in the engine, and named branches for which
 * updates may be published between engines. At the moment, a branch manager does not operate on existing and
 * possibly already modified engines. Instead, it creates a new engine and controls all access to it. This may
 * change in the future.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class does not provide network protocols for achieving this ends. It is the backend containing logic to
 * create and process the information necessary for such messages, but does not mandate any specific protocol
 * formats to be used to transport that information.
 * </p>
